Project to test some toy examples on the DSC loss for highly unbalanced datasets.

Since the introduction of the so-called Dice loss function in 2016 we have been using it for highly unbalanced datasets to improve the result. Empirically, that seems to be the case, but can we actually prove it analitically? This repository is an extension of a paper based on that to test toy examples.
